# lernstick-xkb-data
This package adds some Mac specific keyboard layouts that support the usual Mac shortcuts like cmd+C/cmd+V for copy&paste and accessing third level keys with the left alt key.
This is done by custom xkb symbol tables and RedirectKey actions.
In contrast to other solutions the common Linux keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Alt+Tab for application switching, Meta/Windows for expose in GNOME) continue to work.
